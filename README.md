# RAG Chatbot application

## Project structure

In this project you find 2 directories

1. `backend` containing the server side **python** code
2. `frontend` containing the client side **typescript** code.\
   In both these directories, it is your job to complete the missing modules and add necessary functionalities to make the app fully functional.

### Backend

**Requirements**: Python 3.11.4.

1. `main.py` which is the entry point to our server
2. This project has a few Python packages as dependencies, you can install them in your virtual environment using `requirements.txt`.
3. Then install the python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### Running the backend server

To launch the server, navigate to the `backend` directory and run:

##### `python main.py`

This will start the server at [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)

### Frontend

The project structure within the `frontend` directory follows the official `create-react-app` structure as in the [docs](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/folder-structure). Some of the files have been removed for convenience & brevity.

**Requirements**: We are using `node V20.11.1` and `npm 10.2.4`. They can be downloaded via [installer](https://nodejs.org/en). For more information check [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

#### How to launch the react app

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run `npm install`
2. Then you can run:

   ##### `npm start`

   This will launch the app in development mode.\
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
